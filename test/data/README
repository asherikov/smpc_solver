States:
    All reference data was produced by solvers implemented in Matlab.

    - states_chol_nodowndate.dat
        produced by the solver based on Cholesky decomposition, active
        constraints are never removed from active set.

    - states_chol_downdate.dat
        produced by the solver based on Cholesky decomposition, active
        constraints are removed when necessary.

    - states_inv_downdate.dat
        produced by the solver based on matrix inverse, active constraints 
        are removed when necessary.
