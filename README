This library implements a solver of quadratic optimization problems
defined using sparse model predictive control formulation for
walking motion generation. 

Requirements:
    GNU make

Compilation can be started by running make without targets.
When 'test' target is specified, the tests and examples in the
'test' folder are also build.
